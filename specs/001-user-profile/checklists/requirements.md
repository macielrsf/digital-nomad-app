# Specification Quality Checklist: User Profile Management with Travel Preferences

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Validation Details**:

- ✅ User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- ✅ 12 functional requirements defined, all testable and unambiguous
- ✅ 3 key entities identified with clear boundaries
- ✅ 7 success criteria defined, all measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Edge cases cover validation, size limits, data completeness, and user input scenarios
- ✅ Assumptions documented (auth system exists, image storage available, default preference values specified)
